            <p>About my childhood, one of the things I remember perfectly is me saying: «I wanna
                be an astronomer. » It has been my dream since I remember and now that dream can
                come true.<br>
                As a child, the three wizards gave me a telescope for Christmas and I used to spend
                lots of hours watching the sky with it. Unfortunately it wasn’t a really good one, so I
                only could see little lighting points. But that was enough for me, because the universe
                has always fascinated me. Now I’ve borrowed a bigger telescope from my High School
                and it was amazing seeing the moon’s craters and waking up at 6 am just to see Jupiter
                and his satellites.</p>
